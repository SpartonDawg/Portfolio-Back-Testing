# Portfolio-Back-Testing
Framework for pulling data for a portfolio of equities or currencies, then using a random walker to find best parameters to maximize risk adjusted returns. 
Machine Learning Application - utilizes SKlearn to try and predict when to buy or sell an asset. The accuracy of the model would be equal to -> amount of correct buys / total buy oppurtunities. For example, if the model predicts to buy 3 times in the week, but only 2 days had positive next days meaning there were 2 total buy oppurtunities. The accuracy would be 50%.
